## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#9](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-authz/pull/9) [`07d01de`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-authz/commit/07d01de286e7dfcae5fbeb10b7e8d48533214087) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - Ecosystem improvements across the authz packages.

  ### Permissions

  - **Wildcard / hierarchical permissions.** Permission strings now support wildcard
    and hierarchical matching (e.g. `posts:*` or `posts:read:*`), so a single granted
    permission can authorize a family of related actions instead of enumerating each one.

  ### Authorization decisions

  - **Deny reason / message surfaced on `ForbiddenException`.** When a check fails, the
    reason for the denial is propagated onto the thrown `ForbiddenException`, making it
    possible to return a meaningful message to the caller and to debug authorization
    failures.
  - **Gate `after` hook.** The Gate now exposes an `after` hook that runs once a decision
    has been made, enabling cross-cutting concerns such as auditing, logging, and metrics.

  ### Batch authorization

  - **`allowsMany`** for evaluating multiple permission checks in a single call.
  - **Batch `/authz/can` endpoint** so clients can resolve many checks in one round trip.
  - **`createCanBatch`** client helper that batches `can` calls transparently.

  ### Performance

  - **Request-scoped permission cache.** Permissions resolved during a request are cached
    for the lifetime of that request, avoiding repeated lookups on the hot path.

  ### RBAC adapters (TypeORM)

  - **Direct user permissions** granted to a user independent of their roles.
  - **Tenant-scoped roles** so the same role can be assigned per tenant in multi-tenant
    deployments.

  ### Query scoping / policy filter (ABAC)

  - **ORM-neutral constraint AST.** Policies can produce a portable constraint
    representation describing which rows a subject may access.
  - **Per-ORM application.** The constraint AST is translated and applied for
    **TypeORM**, **MikroORM**, and **Prisma**, giving ABAC-style query scoping that
    filters data at the database layer regardless of the ORM in use.

  ### Testing

  - **New `@dudousxd/nestjs-authz-testing` package** with fakes and helpers for testing
    authorization in consumer applications.
  - **Postgres / MySQL testcontainers + contract tests** so the ORM stores are verified
    against real database engines, and a shared contract suite keeps the adapters
    behaviorally consistent.

  ### Housekeeping

  - **Packaging hygiene** across the published packages.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-authz/pull/2) [`2ecb0f4`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-authz/commit/2ecb0f46342fa4527fc01f1097720f2e7bcf9aa7) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - Initial release of `@dudousxd/nestjs-authz-codegen`: a `@dudousxd/nestjs-codegen` extension that
  discovers `@Can(ability, Resource?)` decorators on your controllers (and, optionally, `@Policy`
  method abilities) and emits a typed `can()` helper into your generated `api.ts`. The discovered
  abilities become a string-literal `AuthzAbility` union, so calling `can()` with an ability that
  doesn't exist on the server is a compile-time error. Routes carrying a `@Can` also expose a
  route-pinned `can()` handle member when a client layer is active.

### Patch Changes

- [#2](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-authz/pull/2) [`2ecb0f4`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-authz/commit/2ecb0f46342fa4527fc01f1097720f2e7bcf9aa7) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - The emitted `can()` now delegates to `@dudousxd/nestjs-authz-client` instead of a
  hand-rolled POST. The generated `api.ts` imports `AbilityStore` + `createCan`, exports a
  shared `authzStore` you hydrate once, and `can()` is a thin typed wrapper over the store's
  `createCan` resolver — so a hydrated decision is answered synchronously with NO request,
  and a cache miss uses the same configurable `'fetch'` fallback to the `endpoint`. The
  compile-time `AuthzAbility` string-literal union is unchanged (a wrong ability is still a
  type error). Adds `@dudousxd/nestjs-authz-client` as an optional peer dependency.
